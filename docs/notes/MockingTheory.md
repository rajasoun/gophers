## Mocking in GO
Mocking is a process used in unit testing when the unit being tested has external dependencies. 
The purpose of mocking is to isolate and focus on the code being tested and not on the behavior or state of external dependencies.
Mocking is creating objects that simulate the behavior of real objects.
