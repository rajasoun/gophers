## Things to Remember

The TDD process and why the steps are important

1. Write a failing test and see it fail so we know we have written a relevant test for our requirements and seen that it produces an easy to understand description of the failure
1. Writing the smallest amount of code to make it pass so we know we have working software
1. Then refactor, backed with the safety of our tests to ensure we have well-crafted code that is easy to work with
