   1. With TDD on writing unit test case and 
   1. Also applied dependency injection(io.reader and io.writer interface) 
   1. Designed low coulping and high cohesive design
   1. Build bin packaging
   1. Build tags (separate unit test from integration testing)
   1. Mocking(when is needed)
   1. Install gotestsum (for Continously Run Go Tests) [click] (https://github.com/gotestyourself/gotestsum)
