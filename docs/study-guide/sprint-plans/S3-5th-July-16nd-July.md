### To Do Tasks:

1. Apply thrid party Packages on tips Project.(like cobra for cli commands line Project) with TDD and MVC design Pattern 
[cobra pkg](https://github.com/spf13/cobra)
-> commands i.e
```
tips <technology> <topic>


<technology> -> git,sfdc,git,docker
<topic> -> if git then clone , push, pull 
```
e.g 
```
commnad: tips git
usage: tips git [--version] [--help] [-C <path>] [-c <name>=<value>]
           [--exec-path[=<path>]] [--html-path] [--man-path] [--info-path]
           [-p | --paginate | -P | --no-pager] [--no-replace-objects] [--bare]
           [--git-dir=<path>] [--work-tree=<path>] [--namespace=<name>]
           <command> [<args>]

These are common Git commands used in various situations:
