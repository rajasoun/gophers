# 2 Weeks Program_ Go-Lang Team 	            Date: 5th of July â€™21 to 16th of July` 21

### To Do Tasks:

1. Apply thrid party Packages on tips Project.(like cobra for cli commands line Project) with TDD and MVC design Pattern 
[cobra pkg](https://github.com/spf13/cobra)
-> commands i.e
```
tips <technology> <topic>


<technology> -> git,sfdc,git,docker
<topic> -> if git then clone , push, pull 
```
e.g 
```
commnad: tips git
usage: tips git [--version] [--help] [-C <path>] [-c <name>=<value>]
           [--exec-path[=<path>]] [--html-path] [--man-path] [--info-path]
           [-p | --paginate | -P | --no-pager] [--no-replace-objects] [--bare]
           [--git-dir=<path>] [--work-tree=<path>] [--namespace=<name>]
           <command> [<args>]

These are common Git commands used in various situations:

start a working area (see also: git help tutorial)
   clone      Clone a repository into a new directory
   init       Create an empty Git repository or reinitialize an existing one
```
1. Shift validation code to cli from model packages.
1. Apply Logging packages in cli packages.
1. How to ensure between two library which one is good for using in the project (between gocron and cron Library)
1. Complete backlogs if necessary

#### ToDo  : Schedule Meeting (as a demo session about what Go-Team has learned) with Raja,Asfar,Maneesh,Venkatesh.
