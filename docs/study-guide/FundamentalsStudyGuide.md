1. Replan above Study plan along with Actuals on Item you have BOTH completed (Remember as a Team and Not as Individuals)
2. Restart Capturing [Learnings](./Learnings.md) and Review them Daily for atleast 45 mins. Else you might forget.
3. Revist [Project Charter](ProjectCharter.md) for every Replan
4. Connect your Learnings to the [Tips Project](https://github.com/rajasoun/tips) - moving forward while you share Go or TDD Concepts (instead of examples from book) - share how you have applied your learnings to the Tips Project
