##  Running Notes

1.	The tips project describes about the commands/tips (as in Linux/Git) used in command line, where users can get commands based on request.
1.	Tips project usually gives commands related to Linux/Git(as terminals in other editors)
1.	Code is written using VS code editor in Go programming language
1.	It covers unit tests using TDD (Test Driven Development).
1.	Tips project is designed by using a framework-MVC (Model View Controller) architectural design pattern.
1.	MVC consists of three main packages as below
*	**View**--cli package(Taking input(title for tip) from console and passing to controller package)
*	**Model**-model package(Taking title parameter from controller and based on title return proper tip to Controller)
*	**Controller**â€”controller package(Prints the tips on console according to user input(title))
 
 #### Example: We can run an app from main function (go run main.go) and get a tip on user input.
